# Nativescript Creator

NativeScript Creator is a simple drag-&-drop tool for going from idea to App Store, with just the drag of a mouse.

## Goals
- [ ] Develop an application that allows NativeScript enthusiasts to quickly prototype apps through a visual interface.

- [ ] Allow users to export their app prototypes into real NativeScript Angular applications.

- [ ] Enable users to import existing NativeScript Angular applications, that have been exported through this tool (_experimental_).

### Limitations
- 3<sup>rd</sup> party plugins will not be available through this tooling.
- Styling visual representations may not be exact to the device.
